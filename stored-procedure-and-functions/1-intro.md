Stored procedures and functions are precompiled database objects that encapsulate a set of SQL statements and logic.
Stored procedures can perform complex operations and are typically used for data manipulation, while functions are designed to compute and return values.
Both improve performance by reducing network traffic and allowing code reuse. 
They also enhance security by providing a layer of abstraction between the application and the database.


What is the stored procedure?
A stored procedure is a program that performs a set of actions repeatedly. A stored procedure differs from a function in that it runs as a unit, whereas a function runs concurrently in the computerâ€™s memory. Stored procedures improve system performance by allowing the program to access data frequently without loading it into memory.

A stored procedure is a computer code that performs actions repeatedly. A stored procedure is run as a unit instead of a function, which performs several actions serially. Stored procedures help accomplish complex tasks with repeated executions. For example, you could use a stored procedure to add several numbers in memory and return the total. Running the same code repeatedly would reduce the time to complete calculations.

What is a function?
A function is compiled and executed every time it is called. Functions must return a value and cannot modify the data received as parameters. Functions cannot change anything and must have at least one parameter. Also, it must return a result. Stored procedures take no parameters, can modify database objects, and need not return results.

Stored procedures join SQL queries into transactions and communicate with the outside world.

Stored procedure vs Function
Stored procedures take no parameters, can modify database objects, and need not return results.
Functions can only have input parameters, whereas procedures can have either input or output parameters.
Functions can be called from procedures, but procedures cannot be called from functions. 
Exceptions can be handled in try-catch blocks within procedures, but try-catch blocks cannot be used within functions. 
Procedures cannot be used in SELECT statements, but functions can be embedded in SELECT statements.
