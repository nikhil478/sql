SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table. They ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data within the table. If there is any violation between the constraint and the action, the action is aborted by the constraint.

Constraints are classified into two types: column level and table level. Column level constraints apply to individual columns whereas table level constraints apply to the entire table. Each constraint has its own purpose and usage, utilizing them effectively helps maintain the accuracy and integrity of the data.

PRIMARY KEY: Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
NOT NULL: Ensures a column cannot contain NULL values.
UNIQUE: Ensures that all values in a column or group of columns are unique.
DEFAULT: Provides a default value for a column when none is specified.
CHECK: Ensures that all values in a column satisfy a specific condition.
FOREIGN KEY: Establishes relationships between tables by referencing a primary key in another table.
